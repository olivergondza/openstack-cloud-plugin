<div>
    OpenStack Availability Zone to use.
    <p/>
    Can be left blank if the OpenStack deployment is free to put the instance on an availability zone of its choice.
    e.g. if your OpenStack deployment has only one availability zone, or if all zones are equivalent.
    <br/>
    Should not be left blank if there are multiple availability zones that are not equivalent as this can result in non-deterministic behavior.
    e.g. if you have different zones for different processor architectures then you should choose a zone appropriate for the selected image.
